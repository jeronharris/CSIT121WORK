        <h2>Image 3: The Choice</h2>
        <img src="red-pill-of-awareness-or-blue-pill-of-unconsciousness.jpg" alt="The Choice">
        <p>Description: This image shows Morpheus, holding out two hands with a red pill in one hand and a blue pill in the other. The image is in black and white except for the colored pills.</p>
        <p>Why I chose this image: I selected this image because it represents the concept of choice and the impact our decisions can have on our perception of reality. It's a powerful visual metaphor for the choices we face in life and the different paths they can lead us down. The image encourages reflection on personal growth, awareness, and the consequences of our choices.</p>

            <h2>Blog Post 1</h2>
            <p>This hands on experience reinforced my understanding of HTML syntax rules, such as ensuring all tags are closed, maintaining proper nesting, and consistently using quotes for attribute values. Finally, I learned how to configure internal and external hyperlinks. Internal links direct users to sections within the same document, while external links navigate to different websites. Overall, Lab02 provided me with a solid foundation in HTML, helping me develop essential web development skills.</p>

            <h2>Blog Post 2</h2>
            <p>In Lab 05, I explored more advanced CSS concepts, particularly focusing on the CSS Box Model and how it affects the spacing and layout of elements on a webpage. I learned how to configure margins and use the float property to position elements side by side, which is crucial for creating fluid, multi-column layouts. Additionally, I experimented with different positioning techniques, such as fixed, relative, and absolute positioning, allowing me to control element placement in a more precise manner.</p>

            <h2>Blog Post 3</h2>
            <p>n Lab 03, I gained a deeper understanding of CSS properties and declarations, which allowed me to configure webpages more effectively. I learned how to differentiate between various CSS properties and how each one can impact the appearance of a webpage. Through hands-on practice, I created valid CSS stylesheets that controlled color and text properties, improving both the functionality and aesthetics of the site. Using external stylesheets to style multiple pages taught me how to apply consistent designs across an entire website efficiently. Additionally, I learned how to design and implement different CSS selectors, such as element, class, id, and descendant selectors, giving me more control over styling specific parts of the webpage. </p>

        <h2>Reflection on Best Design Practices</h2>
        <p>1. Mobile-first design ensures that the layout is user-friendly across devices. Simplifying the content into a single-column format for small screens improves readability.</p>
        <p>2. Using CSS media queries, the layout can be adjusted to utilize more screen space on larger devices, such as switching to multiple columns on desktop screens.</p>
        <p>3. Consistent navigation and anchor links help users quickly navigate between sections of the page, improving user experience on both mobile and desktop views.</p>

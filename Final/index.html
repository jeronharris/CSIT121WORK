<p>This is my portfolio for the class. And the lessons learned: This course taught me a lot about building websites and making sure they work well for everyone. One of the biggest things I learned was testing my work on different browsers and devices. It was surprising how something that looked great on one screen could look completely off on another. By doing this, I realized how important it is to write clean and flexible code so it works everywhere.

  I also got better at combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create websites that aren’t just functional but also look good and feel interactive. Fixing problems in my code helped me think more critically and figure out better ways to solve issues. Each lab I worked on made me more confident in my skills.
  
  In the end, this course showed me how much planning and testing matter in web development. I feel like I’ve built a solid foundation to keep learning and improving.</p>

            <h2>Blog Post 1</h2>
            <p>This hands-on experience reinforced my understanding of HTML syntax rules, such as ensuring all tags are closed, maintaining proper nesting, and consistently using quotes for attribute values. Finally, I learned how to configure internal and external hyperlinks. Internal links direct users to sections within the same document, while external links navigate to different websites. Overall, Lab02 provided me with a solid foundation in HTML, helping me develop essential web development skills.</p>

        <h2>Reflection on Best Design Practices</h2>
        <p>1. Mobile-first design ensures that the layout is user-friendly across devices. Simplifying the content into a single-column format for small screens improves readability.</p>
        <p>2. Using CSS media queries, the layout can be adjusted to utilize more screen space on larger devices, such as switching to multiple columns on desktop screens.</p>
        <p>3. Consistent navigation and anchor links help users quickly navigate between sections of the page, improving user experience on both mobile and desktop views.</p>

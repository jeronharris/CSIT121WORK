  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>In this Lab I learned about HTML form elements like checkbox,radio, textarea and action. I gained experience with structuring content with tables, forms, and navigation bars. Also I learned how to make web pages accessible by using ARIA roles and labels. I also explored responsive design techniques to ensure the navigation bar adapts to different screen sizes. Overall, this lab helped my understanding of website development and what works best.</p>

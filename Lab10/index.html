                <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>WoT Discovery is a system that helps find and connect different devices that are part of the Internet of Things. These devices could be anything from smart home products to industrial level sensors and they all have something called a Thing Description which is just a detailed profile that tells you what the device does and how to use it. The big idea behind WoT Discovery is to make it easier for these devices to find each other and work together without needing much manual setup.

                    It works by allowing devices to search for these profiles, so they can learn about each other and communicate. Like you're setting up a smart home, and you want your lights to connect with your thermostat. WoT Discovery would help the devices find the right profiles for each other and connect automatically, saving time and effort in the setup process. It basically makes IoT devices smarter by helping them understand and connect with one another.
                    
                    The main goal of WoT Discovery is to create a better experience when dealing with IoT devices. Instead of each device needing to be individually set up, it allows devices to find each other and communicate in a simple way. This could help in everything from personal homes to giant industrial setups, making the process more efficient and less frustrating for people or users.</p>

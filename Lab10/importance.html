                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The importance of WoT Discovery is that it makes dealing with smart devices way less of a headache. Normally setting up devices can be a pain because you have to figure out how each one works and get them to talk to each other. With WoT Discovery devices can find each other and connect on their own, which saves alot of time and effort. It takes the guesswork out of setting things up and just makes everything run smoother.

                        This is really important as more and more devices are becoming smart. Without a system like this, every new device you get would be its own headache to set up, which gets annoying fast. WoT Discovery makes it possible for these devices to work together easily, whether it’s in your house, at work, or even in big company. It’s like having a common language for all your gadgets so they can just figure things out.
                        
                        The other big thing is that it makes smart technology accessible to more people. Not everyone wants to spend hours reading manuals or watching tutorials just to make their devices work. WoT Discovery simplifies the process, so even if you’re not a tech savvy person, you can still take advantage of all the great stuff these devices can do. It’s about making technology easier to use and less intimidating.</p>

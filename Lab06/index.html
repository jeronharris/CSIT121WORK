    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Website Name</h2>
        <p>Donchess Sports Computer Ratings and Predictions</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>The target audience is for sports enthusiasts, bettors, and individuals interested in sports predictions and ratings.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>CRAP Design Principles</h2>
        <p>Contrast is used to some extent in separating sections, with darker backgrounds behind text. However, the accessibility audit indicates a need to improve contrast to meet WCAG standards, as this was flagged as an issue in the audit report.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Audit Score</h2>
        <p>According to the accessibility checker, the site's audit score is 75, indicating non-compliance with certain accessibility standards and a potential risk of accessibility lawsuits.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Site Effectiveness</h2>
        <p>The site is somewhat effective in supporting users to complete actions related to sports ratings and predictions. However, the low accessibility score suggests that some users may face challenges in accessing content accurately due to issues such as low contrast.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Site Efficiency</h2>
        <p>For users familiar with sports data, the site is likely efficient, allowing quick access to ratings and predictions. However, accessibility issues could slow down task completion for users with disabilities or those unfamiliar with the layout.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Site Engagement</h2>
        <p>The site is somewhat engaging for its target audience, as it offers up to date sports information. However, the usability could be improved to ensure a more pleasant experience for all users, particularly those who rely on accessible web design.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Recommendation for Improvement</h2>
        <p>To improve accessibility and compliance, the website should address the contrast issue identified in the audit. Using higher contrast colors for text and backgrounds would improve readability for all users, including those with visual impairments. Implementing a more user friendly navigation structure, with clear headings and labels, could also enhance both accessibility and overall user experience.</p>
